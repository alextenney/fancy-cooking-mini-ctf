                    <p> <b>Ingredients:</b> </p>
                    <p>
                        <li>1 and 2/3 cups (210g) sifted all-purpose flour,* (spoon & leveled)</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
                        <li>1/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
                        <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light brown sugar</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
                        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
                        <li>1/4 cup (60g) yogurt*</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) milk*</li>
                        <li>1/4 (60ml) cup pineapple juice (reserved from the canned pineapple or use fresh)</li>
                        <li>1 Tablespoon (15ml) pure vanilla extract </li>
                    </p>

                    <p> <b>Cooking Instructions:</b> </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</li>
                        <li>Prepare topping first: Place 1/4 cup of melted butter into a 9-inch pie dish or 9×2 inch (deep dish) round cake pan. Make sure it is a deep pan. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup of brown sugar. Top with pineapple slices and arrange cherries between the pineapple slices. See my photo for a visual. Set aside.</li>
                        <li>Prepare the cake: In a medium bowl, mix together flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside. In a large microwave-safe bowl, melt butter in the microwave. Whisk in the sugars vigorously getting out any brown sugar lumps – mixture will be gritty. Whisk in egg, yogurt, milk, pineapple juice, and vanilla extract until combined. Slowly mix in dry ingredients until no lumps remain. Batter will be thick.</li>
                        <li> Pour/spoon batter into prepared pan. Make sure it’s not overflowing– this recipe makes enough batter for your deep dish pan. If you find there is too much batter, make a couple cupcakes (20 minutes bake time) on the side. Bake for at 40-48 minutes. Cover loosely with aluminum foil (loosely to avoid the top from sticking to the foil) at the 20 minute mark to avoid browning. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Invert cake on top of a cake stand or a large serving plate. Slice and serve warm, room temperature, or even cold. Try serving with vanilla ice cream – it’s a delicious combination. Cover cake and store for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>HINT: I wonder if you can turn this cake right-side up?</p>
