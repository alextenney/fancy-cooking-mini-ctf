                    My grandmother is really protective of her mashed potato recipe, but still gave it to me. 
                    Apparently she made up some kind of 4 byte block cipher to keep it safe, and I know she likes modular arithmetic, but I can't figure it out. </br>
                    Maybe I'll learn how to make her mashed potatoes someday.
