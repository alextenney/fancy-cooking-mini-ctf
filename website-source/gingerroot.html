                        Back in the day, I used to work as a line cook in a super popular local spot. I won't name-drop the place,
                        it's probably too cool for you anyway. We used to have this <i>amazing</i> dish that used ginger root. I'd probably
                        have a Michelin star by now, but they fired me, can you believe it? They said I just couldn't handle all the orders
                        coming in, all the time. But c'mon! They'd stack up like crazy and I couldn't keep up. Anyway, I hate those guys
                        now. Heck, I'll even give you some insider intel... if you run <code>nc infosecucalgary.ca 9002</code> you can
                        get their super secret ginger recipe that they don't want me to share.
